   Hi ollama, I am writing a fullstack web framework written in golang. and i really enjoy learning all the odds and ends. I have hit a snag however and i was hoping that you can help me with figuring out how to properly do something. So lets say i have thefolling code block:
   @code go
    e := echo.New()
   ...
    e.Static("/", config.Server.Frontend.Dir)
   ...

   @end
   and the config struct is defined in the following code.
   @code go
    type Configuration struct {
    Name   string `yaml:"name"`
        Semver string `yaml:"semver"`
        Server struct {
            JWT      string `yaml:"jwt"`
            Port     int    `yaml:"port"`
            Frontend struct {
                Dir string `yaml:"dir"`
                Api string `yaml:"api"`
            } `yaml:"frontend"`
            Database struct {
                URL       string `yaml:"url"`
                Sqlc      string `yaml:"sqlc"`
                Migration struct {
                    Protocol    string `yaml:"protocol"`
                    Destination string `yaml:"destination"`
                } `yaml:"migration"`
            } `yaml:"database"`
            Cache struct {
                URL string `yaml:"url"`
            } `yaml:"cache"`
            S3 struct {
                URL    string `yaml:"url"`
                Access string `yaml:"access"`
                Secret string `yaml:"secret"`
            } `yaml:"s3"`
        } `yaml:"server"`
    }
   @end
   it seems that the dist file gets does not load properly. for example when going to the `/login` location of the server served from the built javascript does first goes to the `/` location and takes some time to the proper route. Is there a better way to serve the dist file with the echo framework v4 to serve a built javascript dist folder
