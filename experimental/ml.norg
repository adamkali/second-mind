** Running the program for 150_000 bitties
   - we are goning to start off with ocr-ing the first 150 thousand documents so for $6\\frac{\\textrm{s}}{\\textrm{doc}} \\times 150,000 \\textrm{doc}} = 10 \\textrm{days} $
   - looks like python is maxing its resources on one core and is using ~3.1 GiB of memory at one time.
